# Solana Airdrop

A program which leverages the Solana blockchain to "airdrop" SOL from one wallet to another.
* Airdrops are the process of distributing crypto tokens to many wallet addresses
* The owners of these wallets may receive tokens for free or in return for performing some tasks
* Both new and established blockchain projects use airdrops to promote their platform and reward loyal community members
